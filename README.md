## Description
This second week challenge was to create a demo portfolio website from complete scratch. Here I have created the index.html and the Css. Putting this together we have a relatively complete portfolio (excluding parts that I cannot complete due to lacking projects ect..). On this page you can see a brief description of my career and my experience. Furhtermore, you can see my work and what I have completed thusfar. 

## Completed tasks
I have a fully developed portfolio
I have a working navigation
The UI scrolls to the corresponding work
The page resizes to various screen sizes
The layout is responsive and adapts to different viewpoints

## Usage
Once the website is loaded, the application will be easily accessible on all devices and the application will adapt accordingly to various screen sizes. You can navigate the application and click on UIs that will guide you to t=corresponding areas
